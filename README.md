This project requires Ruby 2.3.0 or higher. Below is a link to official installation
instructions. Although it not necessary, it is highly recommended to use a Ruby version manager
such as RVM to install new version of Ruby, 

- [Official Ruby Install](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/)
- [Install RVM](https://rvm.io/rvm/install)
    
#### Install
    1. Checkout Repo
    2. Install ruby (if needed) 2.3.0 or higher
    3. Run `bundle install` in command line

#### Running Tests
    1. Run command `bundle exec rspec` in command line
    
#### Notes & Considerations
    - Currently Product names are case insensitive e.g. "ground beef" and "Ground Beef" are the same product
    - To simplify tests I chose not to make the managers Singletons
